/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a security model with three distinct access patterns:
 * 1.  Private User Data: Each user has a profile document that only they can access and modify.
 * 2.  Collaborative Shared Data: Book clubs are shared spaces where an "owner" has administrative control,
 *     and "members" have read and participation rights.
 * 3.  Public Read-Only Data: Information about books is publicly accessible to all users for discovery,
 *     but cannot be modified through the client API.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile documents, keyed by the user's UID.
 * - /books/{bookId}: Publicly readable book information.
 * - /bookClubs/{bookClubId}: Collaborative book club documents. Access is controlled by an `ownerId` and a `memberIds` array denormalized onto each document.
 * - /bookClubs/{bookClubId}/discussions/{discussionId}: Discussions nested under their parent book club, inheriting access rights.
 * - /bookClubMembers/{bookClubId}/{userId}: Explicit membership records. This provides a clear path for a user to join/leave a club or for a club owner to manage membership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Data is Immutable: The `/books` collection is public for reading but all write operations are disabled by default because the data schema lacks an ownership field. This is a secure-by-default posture.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Book club documents contain an `ownerId` and a `memberIds` array directly on the document. This allows for fast, efficient, and secure authorization checks for the club and its subcollections without needing expensive lookups in other collections.
 * - Dual Membership Management: A user can manage their own membership record in `/bookClubMembers` (joining/leaving), and the book club owner can also manage these records (adding/removing members), providing flexible access control.
